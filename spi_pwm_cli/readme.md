# SPIDRV Master Bare-metal (USART)

This example demonstrates the SPI driver in master mode using USART in a bare-metal configuration. Connect two kits to exchange data; log output over VCOM.

## Purpose / Scope

This bare-metal example uses the Serial Peripheral Interface in master mode (USART). Install this app on one kit and the SPI slave example on a second kit; connect them via the expansion header (CS–CS, SCLK–SCLK, MOSI–MOSI, MISO–MISO). The two devices periodically exchange data; exchanges are logged over VCOM. Use it to learn SPIDRV master operation with USART without an RTOS.

## Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

**Hardware**
- Two Silicon Labs kits with USART/SPI support. Connect CS–CS, SCLK–SCLK, MOSI–MOSI, MISO–MISO.

**Software**
- Simplicity Studio 5 (or later). A serial terminal for VCOM.

## Steps to Run Demo

1. Open the project in Simplicity Studio and build it. Build and flash the slave example on the second kit.
2. Connect the two kits via SPI lines.
3. Flash and run both boards. Connect a serial terminal to either kit's VCOM to see exchange logs.

## Troubleshooting

- **No data exchange:** Verify wiring; ensure one board is master and one is slave; check clock and baud rate.
- **No VCOM output:** Ensure correct VCOM port and baud rate.
- **Build errors:** Verify target part has USART and that SPIDRV is configured for master mode.
